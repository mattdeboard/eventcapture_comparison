Prerequisites:

- You'll need to get Go installed and have your GOPATH set. http://golang.org will tell you everything you need to know for that. It's pretty simple

Starting the web app:
---------------------

- (First time only) To install the non-core packages that are dependencies: `go get -v`. (You need to be be in the /golang/eventcaptureserver/ directory of course)

- To run the web server: `go run eventcaptureserver.go`
